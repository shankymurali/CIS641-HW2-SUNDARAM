       <h1>Technical Interests</h1>


            <p>
                I previously served as a software tester at Veeserv Technologies in India, where my primary responsibilities revolved around software testing. Despite not having direct programming experience, I have a strong foundation in various programming languages, including Python, SQL, Java, and more. My good understanding of programming has helped me become better at testing software and making the software products I worked on of higher quality.          </p>
